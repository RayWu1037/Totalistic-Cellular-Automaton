# Totalistic Cellular Automaton – 1D Simulation in C

## Overview

This project is a 1D totalistic cellular automaton implemented in C.
The program updates a row of cells over time based on a totalistic rule
and prints each generation so you can visualize how patterns evolve.

I built this project for a CS course to practice C programming,
arrays, loops, and working with simple simulation rules.

## Features

- Simulates a 1D totalistic cellular automaton
- Uses an initial configuration of cells (for example from the file `p01`)
- Updates the row of cells for multiple generations
- Prints each generation so patterns can be observed in the terminal
- Lets you experiment with different rules and starting patterns

## Technologies Used

- C programming language
- Arrays and loops
- Basic file I/O (for loading pattern/rule data, if applicable)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RayWu1037/Totalistic-Cellular-Automaton.git
cd Totalistic-Cellular-Automaton
cd "project-1-Totalistic Cellular Automaton (Coding in C A Total Cell-ebration!)"
